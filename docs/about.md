# About WhiteCube Inc

WhiteCube Inc was established in 2009 in Toronto, Ontario. Surrounded by such art and culture, we were inspired! Our goal is to assist institutions in creating exhibitions with the technology you have available. We are trained to create exhibtions with as little or as much technology as possible including projected exhibitions.

 Our team assists in the design and creation of all aspects of your exhibition, from didactics, interactives, and more. If you are interested in our services, please contact us for a **free quote.**
