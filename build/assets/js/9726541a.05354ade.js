Instead of forcing visitors to crane their necks or crouch down to see the art on display, curators began to experiment with artwork place (How the White Cube, 2017). The white cube is the concept of displaying art that is now standardized. This standardization began with placing all work as eye level, leaving space between each artwork, as well as the walls were painted white. The white walls were thought  to act as a frame, rather like the borders of a photograph (White cube). This minimized the visual noise and allowed the visitors to focus on one artwork."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["Our mission is to embody the revolutionary concept and revolutionize museum and gallery exhibition design.
